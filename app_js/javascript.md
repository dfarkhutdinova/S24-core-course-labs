# JavaScript Web Application

## Choice of Framework
I chose to develop the web application using plain JavaScript without any specific framework or library. While frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue.js offer powerful features for building complex web applications, for this project, a simple JavaScript application suffices.

## Best Practices
- **Modular Code**: I structured the JavaScript code into separate modules for better organization and maintainability.
- **DOM Manipulation**: Utilized best practices for interacting with the Document Object Model (DOM) efficiently.
- **Event Handling**: Implemented event-driven programming to handle user interactions.
- **Code Comments**: Added comments to the code to enhance readability and understanding.

## Coding Standards and Quality
- **Consistent Naming Conventions**: Followed consistent naming conventions for variables, functions, and identifiers.
- **Formatting**: Ensured code formatting adheres to standard JavaScript style guidelines.
- **Error Handling**: Implemented error handling techniques to handle unexpected scenarios gracefully.
- **Code Reviews**: Conducted code reviews to identify and address any potential issues or improvements.

## Testing
- **Manual Testing**: Performed manual testing by running the web application in different browsers to ensure cross-browser compatibility.
- **Functional Testing**: Tested the functionality of the web application to verify that it behaves as expected.
- **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**: Invited users to test the web application and provided feedback for further improvements.
