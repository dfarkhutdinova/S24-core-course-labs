# Continuous Integration Best Practices

This document outlines the best practices implemented in the continuous integration (CI) workflow for the project.

## Best Practices Implemented

### Parallel Jobs/Steps

Utilize parallel jobs or steps to speed up the workflow by running tasks concurrently.

### Matrix Builds

Implement matrix builds for testing against multiple Python versions or operating systems to ensure compatibility.

### Automatic Code Formatting and Linting Checks

Incorporate automatic code formatting and linting checks to maintain code quality and style consistency.

### Notifications for Failed Builds

Set up notifications for failed builds to promptly address issues and maintain a healthy codebase.

### Code Coverage Reporting

Integrate code coverage reporting to track test coverage and identify areas for improvement.

### Environment Variables

Utilize environment variables to securely manage sensitive information such as API keys or credentials.

### Pull Request Checks

Implement checks for pull requests to ensure that code changes meet quality standards before merging.

## Build Cache

Utilize build cache to enhance workflow efficiency by caching dependencies or intermediate build artifacts.

## Conclusion

By following these best practices, we aim to improve the visibility, efficiency, and maintainability of our CI workflow.
