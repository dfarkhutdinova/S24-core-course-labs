# Docker Best Practices

## Security Best Practices

### Non-Root User
To enhance the security of our Docker image, we have ensured that it does not run as the root user. Instead, we have created a non-root user and configured our application to run using that user. This helps mitigate potential security vulnerabilities by restricting access to system resources.

## Additional Best Practices Implemented

- **Minimized Layers**: We have minimized the number of layers in our Docker image to reduce its size and improve build performance.
  
- **Hard-Coded Secrets Avoidance**: We have avoided hard-coding any sensitive information, such as passwords or API keys, directly into the Docker image. Instead, we utilize environment variables or external secrets management solutions.

- **Precise Base Image Version**: We have specified a precise version of the base image and language to ensure consistency and avoid unexpected changes in dependencies.

- **Optimized Dockerfile Instructions**: We have optimized our Dockerfile instructions to ensure efficiency and readability, following best practices such as grouping related commands and using multi-stage builds where applicable.

- **Use of .dockerignore**: We have included a .dockerignore file to exclude unnecessary files and directories from the Docker build context, reducing the size of the final image and improving build performance.

## Conclusion

By adhering to Docker best practices, we have enhanced the security, efficiency, and maintainability of our Docker image, ensuring a reliable and secure environment for our application.
