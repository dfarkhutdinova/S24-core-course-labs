# Ansible Documentation

This document provides an overview of the Ansible-related work carried out in this project.

## Overview

In this project, Ansible was used to automate the deployment of Docker on cloud VM instances. This was achieved by developing an Ansible playbook that utilized the geerlingguy.docker role from Ansible Galaxy.

## Repository Structure

The repository structure follows the recommended layout:

```

## Playbooks

### deploy_docker.yaml

The `deploy_docker.yaml` playbook is responsible for deploying Docker on the target hosts. It includes the geerlingguy.docker role to automate the installation and configuration of Docker.

## Inventory

The inventory file `default_aws_ec2.yml` contains information about the target hosts where Docker will be deployed. This file specifies the IP addresses or hostnames of the VM instances in the cloud environment.

## Configuration

The `ansible.cfg` file contains configuration settings for Ansible, such as the location of inventory files and roles.


This `ANSIBLE.md` file provides an overview of the Ansible-related work, including the repository structure, playbooks, inventory, and configuration.

Next, let's create the `README.md` file in the `ansible/roles/docker` folder to document the Docker role:

# Docker Role

This role is responsible for installing and configuring Docker on target hosts using Ansible.

## Requirements

- Ansible 2.0 or later

## Role Variables

- `docker_users`: List of users to add to the Docker group (default: [ansible_user])


## Example Playbook

```yaml
- name: Deploy Docker
  hosts: your_target_hosts
  become: yes
  vars:
    docker_users:
      - "{{ ansible_user }}"  # Add the current user to the docker group

  tasks:
    - name: Include geerlingguy.docker role
      include_role:
        name: geerlingguy.docker
```

Replace `your_target_hosts` with the hostname or group of hosts where you want to deploy Docker.
