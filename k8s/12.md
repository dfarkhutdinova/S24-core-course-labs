# Lab 12: Kubernetes ConfigMaps
In Kubernetes, a Pod is the smallest deployable unit that can be created and managed. It represents a single instance of a running process in your cluster. Monitoring the status of Pods is crucial for understanding the health and performance of your applications.

Below is the status of the Pods currently running in our Kubernetes cluster:
```bash
(venv) (base) dilaraf@MacBook-Air k8s % kubectl get po
```
### Output
```bash
